    "Game of Life and other cellular automata occupy a fun space. The rules which govern them are simultaneously incredibly easy to understand and implement (although scaling up to humongous world sizes presents various technical challenges), AND complex enough that they can result in the emergence of highly-recognizable creatures and events. In effect, these models provide fully-functional virtual worlds to explore, which are governed by physics that is much simpler than that in our own Universe, but still contain interesting goings-on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, the description of these cellular automata aligns nicely with the way physicists understand our world today. The most fundamental formulations of modern physics have more or less done away completely with ideas of particles and objects moving around, instead describing the world in terms of <b>[fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics))</b>. These physical fields, like the electromagnetic field for instance, exist everywhere, taking on a value at each point of space and time, and the current understanding is that even living creatures are ultimately the result of fluctuations in the configuration of all of these fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Game of Life world seen above is similar; all of its interesting behavior is most primitively described in terms of a simple binary field, which takes a value of either one or zero at every point. The model then acts as an extremely simplified model of a world described by the physics of fields. In the real world though, the fields found in Nature also have another interesting property - they obey the rules of <b>[quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory)</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately the goal of this project is to introduce a <i>quantum</i> cellular automaton as a virtual example of a world which shares this property. However before we can do that we'll have to first understand another example of a classical cellular automaton. Game of Life has the property that its rules are <b>irreversible</b> - that is, many initial states of the grid can evolve to the same final state, so given a particular final state, we'd have no idea how the grid evolved up to that point. This is in contrast to the way rules work in quantum theories. In a particular sense which we will define shortly, quantum evolution is always reversible. In the next notebook therefore, we'll introduce a reversible cellular automaton called <b>Critters</b>, which will be easy to make comply with quantum mechanics."
